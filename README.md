# customer_trend_data_analysis_SQL-Python-PowerBi

1. Overview
   
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to business insights and executive presentation.

The project includes:

Loading and processing data using Python

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and transforming data

Running analytical queries in SQL

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard

Creating a structured analytical report

The objective is to extract meaningful insights and present them in a clear, business-ready format.

2. Tools & Technologies

3. Project Workflow / Steps
Step 1: Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked structure, data types, and missing values

Performed initial inspection

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Corrected inconsistent data formats

Converted data types (dates, numerics)

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Distribution analysis

Trend analysis over time

Correlation analysis

Business KPI exploration

Step 4: SQL Analysis

Data was loaded into SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server) for advanced querying:

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

GROUP BY analysis

Window functions

Ranking top-performing categories

Business KPI calculations

Customer segmentation queries

Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard including:

KPI Cards (Revenue, Orders, Customers, Growth %)

Time-series analysis

Category performance breakdown

Geographic analysis (if applicable)

Filters and slicers for dynamic insights

Step 6: Reporting

Created a structured analytical report including:

Problem Statement

Key Insights

Business Recommendations

Data-driven conclusions
